            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108669:2"/>our Duetie, according to the truſt committed to us, and the carriage of ſome who either oppreſt with a Lethargie, lye ſtill, or ſeazed upon by a benumming coldneſſe, move ſlowlie, or <hi>carried about with the wynde of Strange Doctrine, as children are toſſed to and fro,</hi> and move contrarilie, Conſtrayn us to lift up our voyces, &amp; from the Watch-tower, whereon wee are ſet, To give warning unto the Profeſſours and Miniſters of the GOSPELL throughout the Land, and to waken them up to their duetie, as they would avoyd the diſpleaſure of the ALMIGHTIE, And eſcape the deſerved puniſhments and cenſures which may bee inflicted by Iudicatories Civile and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick reſpective, upon deficients in, &amp; delinquents againſt duetie, according to the Degree of their offence.</p>
            <p>Wee exhort all men unto Repentance, to return from the evill of their thoughts and wayes, and to mourn after the LORD, comming to Him through the MEDIATOR of the New Teſtament, by whom wee have an Attonement tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Fayth in His Blood, It is more then high tyme for all to bee humbled under the Mightie Hand of GOD, who hath caſt us down, And is able to rayſe us up agayn, who hath wounded, and is able to bynd up our wounds. To this effect wee have appoynted a Solemn Day of Faſt and Humiliation, for the cauſes ſent unto the ſeverall Presbyteries.</p>
            <p>It is the Duetie of the Members of this KIRK, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this kingdom, at this tyme, moſt chearfullie unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſlie and ſpeedilie to come out, and concurre in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defence of Religion, King, and kingdom, endangered by the unjuſt Invaſion of Forraigners, according to the call and command of Authoritie: Let it bee ſeriouſlie layd to heart, how much blood is ſpilt, how manie Townes and Shyres are ſpoyled, how miſerablie our Brethren are diſtreſſed and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, how much the common Enemie is ſtrengthened, while you are onlie preparing for Reliefe. <hi>What-ſo-ever is done to the least of them for this Cauſe, is to bee taken as done to vs all in generall, and to everie one of vs in particular,</hi> according to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108669:2"/>to the expreſſe wordes of the Nationall COVENANT. And in playne tearmes, wee are obliedged by the Solemne League and Covenant <hi>to aſſist</hi> (which neceſſarilie importeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence) <hi>and defende all that enter the League and Covenant in the maintaining thereof,</hi> Wee obteſt and exhort you for the Intereſt wee have in the common Adventure of theſe rich goods our Lyves, our Liberties, our King, our Religion, which are all embarked in one bottome, that yee abandone not the ſhip of the Common-wealth in this Tempeſt; For if the Ship periſh, what can bee ſafe that is within?</p>
            <p>If you tender true Religion, you ſee how the <hi>Sectaries</hi> ſhow themſelves playne enemies thereto, and maintaine that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious monſter of <hi>Toleration;</hi> Though Religion were not in the Queſtion, Let Loyaltie to your King, the onlie King in the world, Who is in a Religious Covenant with GOD and His People, animate you agaynſt theſe who are his enemies, Becauſe hee is a King, and becauſe Covenanted; Caſt not off the care you ought to have of your Countrey, which yee ſee many feſtlie and violentlie Ruined before your eyes. If theſe will not move you (wee ſpeake the language of our worthie <q>Reformers in the lyke caſe of Invaſion by forraigners) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your Wyves, Children, and Poſteritie; your Ancient Heritages and Houſes; And bee aſſured theſe Strangers will not regard your Rights, when ever occaſion ſhall ſerve; And if yee purpoſe, (As wee doubt not, but all theſe who have either wit or manhood will declare and prove indeed) to brooke your Ancient Rowmes and Heritages, defended va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly by your cowragious Progenitours agaynſt all Strangers Invaders of the ſame (ſuch as the <hi>Sectaries</hi> are this day) If you will not bee ſlaves to them, and have your Lyves, your Wyves, your Children, your Subſtance, and what-ſo-ever is deare unto you caſt at their feete, to bee uſed and abuſed, at the pleaſure of ſtrange Souldiours: If yee will not have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſome day in your owne perſons (as wee ſuppoſe the leaſt of you would not gladlie have, but would rather chooſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108669:3"/>with Honour to die in defence of his own Native Rowme, then live and ſerve ſo ſhamefull a ſervitude) Then Brethren, joyne with the Forces of the Kingdom, and both with Wit &amp; Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood oppoſe the common Enemie; Or elſe our Liberties ſhall bee here-after dearer bought. Let none bee ſo unhappie and miſchievous, And ſo with-draw himſelfe herefrom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Except men will blot out of their hearts the love of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, caſt off Loyaltie to Soveraigne Authoritie, and lay aſyde all care of their Countrey, Lawes, Liberties, and Eſtates, yea, all naturall affection to the preſervation of what-ſo-ever is deareſt to them under the Sunne, (all being in a viſible Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Ruine and Deſtruction) They muſt now or never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare activelie, each one ſtretching himſelfe to the uttermoſt of his power. It is no tyme now to delay, nor goe about the buſineſſe by halffes, nor bee almoſt, but all-together zealous. The Scripture pronounceth him curſed, that doeth the Work of the LORD negligentlie, that commeth not foorth to the helpe of the LORD agaynſt the Mightie. If wee have been forward to aſſiſt our neyghbour kingdomes, ſhall wee neglect to defend our owne? Or ſhall the Enemie of GOD bee more active agaynſt His Cauſe, then His Covenanted Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for it? GOD forbid. If the Work ſhall now miſcarrie and fayle in our handes through our unfaynthfulneſſe, our owne conſcience ſhall condemne us, and Poſteritie ſhall curſe us. Who knoweth, but if wee ſtand ſtoutlie and ſteadfaſtlie to it, the LORD may yet command our Delyverance, and ſhow us His Salvation.</p>
            <p>Let all ſortes both of High and Lowe Degree in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, call to mynde their Solemne Covenantes; and namelie, that Article of our Nationall Covenant, which obliedgeth us not to <q>ſtay nor hinder anie ſuch reſolution as by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhall bee found to conduce for the endes of the Covenant: But by all meanes to further and promove the ſame:</q> Which lyeth as a bond upon peoples conſciences readilie to obey ſuch ordours, as by the publick reſolution of the Parliament, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108669:3"/>Commiſſion of the Generall Aſſemblie, are found neceſſarie for the proſecution of the Warre; And that Article of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne League and Covenant which obliedgeth us. <q>Not to ſuffer our ſelves directlie nor indirectlie by what-ſome-ever Combination, Perſwaſion, or Terrour, to bee divyded and with-drawne, from this Bleſſed Union and Conjunction, or to make defection to the contrarie part, Or to give our ſelves over to a deteſtable indifferencie, and neutralitie in the Cauſe. According to which Article Mens realitie and integritie in the Covenant will bee manyfeſt and demonſtrable;</q> As well by their omiſſions as Commiſſions, by their not doing good, as by their doing evill.

            <p>Let Miniſters as the Meſſengers of the LORD, ſtirre up others both publickly, by free and faythfull Preaching, and privately, by admoniſhing everie one of his Duetie, as there ſhall bee occaſion. <q>Conſidering that ſilence in the publick Cauſe; Eſpeciallie in publick Faſtes, not labouring to cure the diſaffection of people, not urging them to conſtancie and patience, in bearing of publick burthens, nor to forwardneſſe in the publick cauſe: That ſpeaking ambiguouſly, inclyning to juſtifie the wicked cauſe, uttering wordes which ſavour of diſaffection, complayning of the tymes in ſuch a way as may ſteale the heartes of people from lyking good inſtrumentes in this Work, and conſequentlie from GODS Cauſe;</q> Yea,
